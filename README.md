# sbtMaps

# These scripts are designed to allow the daily download and mapping of sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, and sea surface height anomaly for 
# the northeast Indian Ocean, to support a sampling cruise looking for larval southern bluefin tuna ("BLOOFINZ") at sea in January 2022. 
# The environmental fields can be applied to a species distribution model (Generalized Additive Model) for larval Atlantic bluefin tuna, trained on data 
# collections from the Gulf of Mexico. However, we don't know if larval habitats are similar across the two species, so these outputs should be interpreted
# with caution
